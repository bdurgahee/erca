# What is it? #

Erca is a framework that eases the use of [Formal and Relational Concept Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis), a neat clustering technique.

# Ok, But, What is Formal Concept Analysis? #

I guess you'll have to read the FcaIntroduction page.

# What can it do? #

Erca offers the following features:

  * Easy import of formal contexts from [CSV](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files (editable with [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/) Excel, ...)
  * Clean and readable syntax to describe formal contexts
  * Clean and readable syntax to describe relational context families
  * Algorithm that computes the concept lattice of a formal context
  * Algorithm that computes the concept lattice family of a relational context family
  * Easy export of the produced lattices to [dot](http://www.graphviz.org) graphs (that can be later on exported to JPG, PNG, EPS and SVG)
  * Seamless integration into [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) as en Eclipse plug-in
  * Erca can be easily extended (custom filters, ...) by writing small plug-ins in Java
